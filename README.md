# Ctrl-Alt-Home

Ctrl-Alt-Home *is going to* be a alternative home automation controller.

It will expand on [Barnaby Gray's GoHome](https://github.com/barnybug/gohome)
and various other projects linked below to reach the system I want and need.

## Goals

Note the word, "goals", as in thing might come at one point ;)

- Security & Privacy
  - No Internet connectivity needed per default, remote control can be done using a VPN.
  - Auditable code
  - Upgradeable code (Debian Packages)
  - No "Calling home"
  - Privacy
- Controlling:
  - Mini website, for setting up schedules and other things one only rarely configures
  - [Apple Homekit](https://github.com/brutella/hc) support, allowing quick controlling from iOS devices
- Devices:
  - [RFXLAN](http://www.rfxcom.com) using [gorfxtrx](https://github.com/barnybug/gorfxtrx) for Oregon Sensors and Somfy Screens
  - [Shelly](http://shelly.cloud/) using [Tamota Shelly 1](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Shelly-1/) / [Tamota heelly 2.5](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Shelly-2.5/)
  - [Philips Hue]() using [Kelvin](https://github.com/stefanwichmann/kelvin).
  - [Enviro+](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-enviro-plus)
